Plans for scripts

tagging.py - tagging system to assign tags to various files and store in a primitive database
------------
CURRENT priority:
input a file
hash the file and assign the hash to a filename by writing to a textfile
assign IDs to the hashes by writing to the textfile
input tags for said file
write tags to the file
write IDs under tags in the tagfile

HIGH priority:
bulk file tagging (e.g. tag all files in a folder, tag all files passed to the script)
tag assignment "fixing" - rehash all files in a folder to reassign hashes to new filenames

MEDIUM priority:
input tags to be removed or added to already-tagged file
assigning favorite/rating (e.g. safe, questionable, explicit) to images
different tag types (e.g. artist, series/IP, character, general)
-----------

search.py
-----------
CURRENT priority:
input tags for a search
read tagfile
query tagfile for all IDs that match the tags
return all filenames that match the tags

HIGH priority:
search regex (e.g. wildcard, all files matching [tag] but not [tag], all files matching [tag] or [tag])

MEDIUM priority:
less important search regex (e.g. favorites only, rating) (kind of goes with favorites/rating)
